>=14.2.1
--------

* Ceph now packages python bindings for python3.6 instead of
  python3.4, because EPEL7 recently switched from python3.4 to
  python3.6 as the native python3. see the `announcement <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/epel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EGUMKAIMPK2UD5VSHXM53BH2MBDGDWMO/>_`
  for more details on the background of this change.

* Nautilus-based librbd clients can now open images on Jewel clusters.
